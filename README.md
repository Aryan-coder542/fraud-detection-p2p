# P2P Fraud Detection: Decentralized AI for Banking Networks

## Problem Statement
Banks need to detect fraud collaboratively but cannot share sensitive customer data due to privacy regulations and competitive concerns.

## Solution
A decentralized AI system where banks:
1. Train fraud detection models locally on their own data
2. Share only fraud patterns and signals (not raw data)
3. Use blockchain for transparent, auditable collaboration
4. Improve collective fraud detection without compromising privacy

## How It Works
1. **Local Training**: Each bank trains ML models on their transaction data
2. **Signal Sharing**: Banks share fraud detection patterns via blockchain
3. **Federated Learning**: Collective insights improve individual bank models
4. **Blockchain Trust**: All sharing activities are logged and auditable
